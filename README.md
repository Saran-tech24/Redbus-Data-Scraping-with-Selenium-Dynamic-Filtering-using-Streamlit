# Project Title:

Redbus Data Scraping with Selenium & Dynamic Filtering using Streamlit

**Skills Acquired:**

1.Web Scraping with Selenium

2.Python Programming

3.Streamlit for Interactive Applications

4.SQL for Data Storage and Retrieval

**Domain:**

Transportation

**Problem Statement:**

The project aims to automate data collection from Redbus using Selenium, storing the data in a SQL database, and developing an interactive Streamlit application for data filtering and visualization. This solution enhances decision-making in the transportation industry.
 
**Approach:**

### Data Scraping: 

 * Extract bus routes, schedules, prices, and availability from Redbus.
    
### Data Storage: 

* Save scraped data in a SQL database.

### Streamlit Application: 

* Develop an app to display and filter data with various criteria like bus type, route, price range, etc.

**Deliverables:**

1.Source code for scraping, SQL interaction, and Streamlit app.

2.SQL scripts for creating the database.

3.Documentation and screenshots of the Streamlit app.
